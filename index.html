        <h2 class="container"> Biography</h2>
        <p>Jane Austen was born on December 16, 1775, in Steventon, Hampshire, England, to a large, supportive family. Her father, a clergyman, encouraged her education and love of reading. Austen began writing as a child, crafting plays, stories, and eventually, novels. Despite her relatively quiet life, her keen observations of the social dynamics around her formed the backbone of her work. Her writing was often focused on marriage, class, and relationships within the context of British society during the Georgian era.</p>

        <p> Austen lived most of her life in the countryside, though she spent time in Bath and other parts of England. She never married, though she did have brief flirtations and a proposal she turned down. Her writing career was limited by the constraints of her time, particularly the difficulties faced by women seeking publication. Several of her novels were published anonymously.</p>

        <h2 class="container"> Famous Works</h2>
        <li>Pride and Prejudice (1813)</li> <p>Arguably her most famous work, this novel explores themes of love, class, and morality through the character of Elizabeth Bennet and her complicated relationship with Mr. Darcy.</p>
        <li>Sense and Sensibility (1811)</li> <p>This novel contrasts the two Dashwood sisters, Elinor (representing "sense") and Marianne (representing "sensibility"), in their pursuit of love and happiness. </p>
        <li>Emma (1815)</li> <p> Focuses on the life of the meddling yet endearing protagonist, Emma Woodhouse, and her misjudgments in matters of romance. </p>
        <li>Persuasion (1817)</li> <p>Her final completed novel, it tells the story of Anne Elliot, who reunites with her former love after many years, reflecting on themes of regret and second chances. </p>
        <h2 class="container"> Death</h2>
        <p>Jane Austen died on July 18, 1817, at the age of 41, likely from Addison’s disease or Hodgkin's lymphoma. Her final years were marked by illness, though she continued to write until the end. She is buried in Winchester Cathedral.</p>
        <h2 class="container"> Legacy</h2>
        <p>Though Austen's works were not widely recognized during her lifetime, today she is considered one of the greatest English novelists. Her sharp wit, intricate plotting, and acute social commentary have made her novels timeless classics. Austen's works continue to be widely read, adapted into films and television, and studied for their rich portrayals of 19th-century society and their relevance to modern readers.</p>

        <h2 class="container">Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Born Eric Arthur Blair on June 25, 1903, in Motihari, British India, George Orwell was a British novelist, essayist, and critic, best known for his dystopian works. He was educated at Eton College in England, where he was introduced to literature. After school, Orwell joined the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, an experience that influenced much of his later work, particularly his criticisms of imperialism. After returning to England, he pursued writing and lived in poverty, working various jobs and exposing himself to the harsh conditions of the working class.</p>

            <p> Orwell became politically engaged during the Spanish Civil War, where he fought for the Republican side against Franco’s forces. His experiences with political disillusionment during this war deepened his anti-totalitarian stance, which would permeate his later works. He was also a vocal critic of Stalinism and fascism, and his writings offered profound critiques of authoritarianism and the abuse of power.
        </p>
        <h2 class="container">Famous Works</h2>
            <li>Animal Farm (1945)</li> <p> A satirical allegory of the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalinism, this novella uses farm animals to represent key figures and events from Soviet history, exploring themes of power, betrayal, and oppression.</p>
            <li>1984 (1949)</li>  <p>Perhaps his most famous work, this dystopian novel presents a totalitarian regime that controls every aspect of life, including thoughts. It introduces the concept of "Big Brother" and explores themes of surveillance, censorship, and the manipulation of truth.</p>
            <li>Homage to Catalonia (1938)</li>   <p> Orwell’s memoir of his experiences fighting in the Spanish Civil War, this work highlights his disillusionment with both fascism and the Communist Party.</p>
            <li>Down and Out in Paris and London (1933)</li>   <p>This autobiographical work provides a vivid account of Orwell’s time living in poverty in two major cities, revealing his empathy for the downtrodden and marginalized.</p>
            <h2 class="container">Death</h2>
            <p>Orwell's health was always fragile, partly due to his time in the Spanish Civil War and later exacerbated by tuberculosis, which he contracted in the 1930s. He continued to write until his death from tuberculosis on January 21, 1950, at the age of 46.</p>
            <h2 class="container">Legacy</h2>
            <p>George Orwell's works have had a profound influence on political thought and popular culture. His critique of totalitarianism, imperialism, and the corruption of ideals remains deeply relevant. The terms "Orwellian," "Big Brother," and "thoughtcrime" have entered the lexicon as descriptions of oppressive government control. His works continue to be studied for their insights into power, politics, and human nature.</p>
